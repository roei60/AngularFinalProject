To insert destinations to db, open cmd in mongo installation dir and run this command
(note that Destination.json file path may be different in your file system, so put full path of it):

mongoimport.exe --host localhost --db flights --collection destinations < D:\AngularProject\Destinastion.json --jsonArray
